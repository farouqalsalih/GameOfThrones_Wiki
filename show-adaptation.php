            <p class="firstLetter">
                A Song of Ice and Fire and Game of Thrones have a broad, active international fan base. In 2012 Vulture ranked the series's fans as the most devoted in popular culture, more so than those of Lady Gaga, Justin Bieber, Harry Potter or Star Wars.[362] Fans include political leaders such as former US president Barack Obama,[363][364] former British prime minister David Cameron,[365] former Australian prime minister Julia Gillard[366] and Dutch foreign minister Frans Timmermans, who framed European politics using quotes from Martin's novels in a 2013 speech.[367]
